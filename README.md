## Background
Sudoku is a number-based puzzle that was original developed in Japan.
In Sudoku, the board is a 9-by-9 grid of cells into which values in
the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} can be entered. The constraints
of the puzzle are that there can be no duplicate values in any row
or column of the Sudoku board. A valid solution to a Sudoku puzzle
is a solution that satisfies these constraints.
